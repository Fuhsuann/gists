I'm a weird person.
I like writing $\text{\LaTeX}$. With all of its downsides, it's quite flexible.

This blog post is written in \texttt{tex} file, not markdown.
With the help of \href{https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2020-03-06-latex-svg.html}{\texttt{latex-svg}},
the included math and some \emph{other} environments work.
We are still constrained by what pandoc supports, but there is a lot.

\section{Examples}

Let us write few examples of what we can do.

\subsection{Math}

Formulas

\begin{equation*}
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
\end{equation*}

or

\begin{align*}
\sin' &= \cos \\
\cos' &= - \sin
\end{align*}

work nicely.

\subsection{tikzcd}

As \texttt{pandoc} can preserve raw latex blocks and \texttt{latex-svg}
renders them, you can draw \texttt{tikzcd} diagrams:

\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[r,"f"] & B
\end{tikzcd}

\subsection{Tables}

Writing tables in markdown is a pain. It is painful in $\text{\LaTeX}$ also but less.

\begin{tabular}{lcr}
foo & bar & quu \\
\hline
foo1 & 2345678 & quu9 \\
foo123 & 456 & quu789
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Code snippets}

\texttt{pandoc} recognizes \texttt{code} environment. So we get code highlighting!

\begin{code}
fact :: Integer -> Integer
fact n = product [2 .. n]
\end{code}

\section{Rendering as PDF}

The benefit of writing posts in $\text{\LaTeX}$ is that you can convert to PDF.
You can also start with markdown, and use pandoc to convert it to tex document,
and that is what more reasonable people do.
