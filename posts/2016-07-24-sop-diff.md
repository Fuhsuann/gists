title: Generic structure diff
author: Oleg Grenrus

At the [ZuriHac 2016](https://wiki.haskell.org/ZuriHac2016) I worked on the new
[parsec-based parser for the *.cabal
files](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2865).  The obvious test case is
to compare new and old parser results for all of Hackage.  Traversing the
Hackage is quite trivial. The difficult part is inspecting the result
[GenericPackageDescription](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Cabal-1.24.0.0/docs/Distribution-PackageDescription.html#t:GenericPackageDescription)s
to spot the difference.  In the same event, [Andres
Löh](https://www.andres-loeh.de/l) presented his library
[generics-sop](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop). Obvious choice
to quickly put something together for the repetetive task. After all you can
compare records field-wise.  And if sum constructors are different, that's
enough for our case as well!  Generic programming ftw.

At the end, we get boilerplate-less diffing implementation for comparing nesting
record types:

```hs
λ *SopDiff > prettyResultIO $ diff (Foo 1) (Bar $ Ex2 "bar" True)
 : 
- Foo
+ Bar
λ *SopDiff > prettyResultIO $ diff (Bar $ Ex2 "barr" False) (Bar $ Ex2 "bar" True)
Bar exName : 
- "barr"
+ "bar"
Bar exDone : 
- False
+ True
```
