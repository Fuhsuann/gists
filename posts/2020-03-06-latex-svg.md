title: "ANN: latex-svg packages"

I occasionally write blog posts with some math.
So far I have been using [`latex-formulae`](https://github.com/liamoc/latex-formulae) family of packages.
This week Andres LÃ¶h asked whether $\text{\LaTeX}$ can be rendered as SVGs.

The answer is **yes**.

The [`preview`](https://ctan.org/pkg/preview) CTAN package, and 
the [`dvisvgm`](https://dvisvgm.de/) tool make it very easy.
I forked `latex-formulae` into [`latex-svg`](https://github.com/phadej/latex-svg) to use above mentioned tools. There are three packages on Hackage now:

* [latex-svg-image](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/latex-svg-image): render LaTeX formulae to SVG images
* [latex-svg-pandoc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/latex-svg-pandoc): render LaTeX formulae in pandoc documents
* [latex-svg-hakyll](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/latex-svg-hakyll): render LaTeX formulae in hakyll pages

To mention some differences between `latex-formulae` and `latex-svg`:

- `latex-svg-image` uses only `latex` and `dvisvgm`, ImageMagick *is not required*. You don't need to tweak `policy.xml` to allow rasterization of PostScript.
  (See [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52998331/imagemagick-security-policy-pdf-blocking-conversion)).
- `latex-svg-image` supports global cache (off by default), which speedups [`hakyll`](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) site builds. My blog builds in 20 seconds instead of three minutes with empty cache. I wouldn't worry about space usage too much, the cache contents take 15M after building my blog. which is way less than the size of `site` executable.
- `latex-svg-hakyll` has `initFormulaCompilerSVGPure` variant, which doesn't need `IO` to be created. You don't need to thread `renderFormulae` function through.
  Together with global cache, the perfomance penalty is small.
- One drawback is that result pages become bigger (and slower). For example a formula-heavy https://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2018-12-12-find-correct-laws.html is

    - `576k` in size with `latex-formulae`
    - `2819k` in size with `latex-svg` (almost 5 times larger).

  Rendering SVG images is also more CPU expensive.

Otherwise the API and module names are the same. If you are already a user of
`latex-formulae` you can easily migrate to `latex-svg`.

At the end few examples. We can type set quadratic formula

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

or an exponent tower like

$$
x^{x^{x^{x^x}}}
$$

or a charterization of equality of real numbers using "downsets"

$$
(x = y) \leftrightarrow (\forall z. (z \le x) \leftrightarrow (z \le y))
$$

from [a recent post](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/what-would-dijkstra-do-proving-the-associativity-of-min/) by Brent Yorgey.

The difference is clearly visible on high-DPI displays, for example mobile devices.

Update 0.2: Font size and raw tex blocks
-----------------------------------------------

As the font-size can be configured, the inline math like $x^2 + y^2$
looks nicer. Also note that the baseline is taken into account.

For example you can draw [tikz-cd](https://ctan.org/pkg/tikz-cd?lang=en) diagrams:

\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[d, "g"] \arrow[r, "f"] & B \arrow[r, "\alpha"] \arrow[d, "\gamma"] & D \arrow[d, "\beta"] \\
C \arrow[r, "h"] & B' \arrow[r, "\lambda"] & D'
\end{tikzcd}

For this to work the `Ext_raw_tex` pandoc extension should be enabled.
