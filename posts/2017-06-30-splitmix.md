Pure Haskell implementation of SplitMix described in

Guy L. Steele, Jr., Doug Lea, and Christine H. Flood. 2014. Fast splittable
pseudorandom number generators. In Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International
Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages & Applications
(OOPSLA '14). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 453-472. DOI:

In simple benchmarks generating `Word64`: `splitfix`
is *3-7x* faster than [`tf-random`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tf-random)
and *15-70x* faster than [`random`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/random).
(The difference aren't as huge, when generating `Int`)

Another difference is the fact that `splitmix` generates 64bit integers (`Word64`).
`tf-random` generates 32bit (`Word32`) and `random` ordinary integers (`Int`).
Generating 64 bit integers "natively" is nice, as we need only single step to generate `Double`,
which are useful for Monte-Carlo simulations.

`splitmix` also performs well in [dieharder](http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php) tests.
